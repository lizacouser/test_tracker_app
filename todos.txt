re: coding my test taking app
- [x] Add selected property to html form for filtering
- [ ] Add PSATs
- [ ] make all if test type = ACTs into switch cases to add more possible tests
- [x] automatically projected if you don't fill out all section scores
- [x] updating score is updating baseline every time!!
- [ ] refactor update score to make better use of test type
- [ ] refactor scoreString to just filter non-null values and map to ACT/SAT label array
- [x] bug in "mark all incomplete" not toggling the todo, but is clearing baseline
- [ ] is it worth replacing all the test_id in the parameters with students_tests_ids, and doing look-ups by st id instead of student_id combined with test_id??
- [x] calculate highest score
- [x] add cumulative score to data
- [x] compare baselines with highest score
- [x] convert SAT to ACT
- [ ] track what techniques you've covered
- [ ] add space for notes?
- [x] change to has_score rather than hasScore
- [ ] Add flash messaging for checking “projected” or “mock” without scores?
